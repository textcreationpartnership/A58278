            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOur Letters the 29. of <hi>March,</hi> I received the 14. of <hi>Aprill:</hi> I muſt tell you of all is nought with us for want of money, here lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded yeſterday 400 Dragoners, and it is reported that 300 more goes to <hi>Tredaugh,</hi> yet I am not very ſure of it, our Souldiers have no ſhooes, ſo that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not travell bare-footed, and there is but 12000. l. landed, which will not pay the Souldiers for a weeke.</p>
            <p>The 12. of <hi>Aprill</hi> the Earle of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Coote,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas</hi> with others went forth with 4000 foote and 300 horſe to goe 40. myles compaſſe Southward and Southweſt, and to doe all the ſpoyle they could, killing of man, woman, and child, to burne all places with Corne and Hay, but whether they be gone, we yet know not, 'tis ſaid they went to <hi>Catherlo, Trim,</hi> and <hi>Marronborough,</hi> from whom we have not heard theſe 14. dayes, neither can they ſend, unleſſe by a good Convoy, for the Rebels lye upon every paſſage, and they that doe moſt hurt, are the Churles who goe to Plough all day, but in the night they kill every body they can take, as wee have

            <p>The Rebels are ſtrong, and now they have ſtore of ammunition and Armes; an Engliſh Ship is put in at <hi>Galway</hi> laden with Salt, ſo the Towneſmen went out to buy it, but in concluſion tooke the Ship with 8. peeces of Ordnance, and 6. Barrels of Powder, Mr. <hi>Darcy</hi> and Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> Lawyers, were the greateſt Actors in all this Treaſon: The Fort of <hi>Galway</hi> is in great diſtreſſe for want of Munition and Armes: The Juſtices have ſent one of the Kings Ships that brought us Victuals and Ammunition, to carry all neceſſaries unto them, but God knoweth whether it will come to them in due time, for they muſt have many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall winds: We heare that a Ship is put into <hi>Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> and brought 300 Barrels of Powder, with ſtore of other proviſion, and one other ſmall ſhip to <hi>Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> which this ſhip hath taken, and leſt it at <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale,</hi> but the Birds were flowne, and there landed 40. Commanders, and Munition, another was landed at <hi>Dungarven,</hi> and put a ſhore Commanders and Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and another at <hi>Waxford</hi> with men and Munition.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Montgarret</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Ormonds</hi> Brother ſent to our Army, that they would fight with them before their returne: Sir <hi>Henry Titchbourne</hi> is yet at <hi>Dund<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:99422:3"/>ſtayed not &amp; went thither again, carried 100 horſe &amp; 200 foot, but they had no ſhooes, ſo that they cannot doe much good: We heare not of any <hi>Scots</hi> yet lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the North, Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> keepeth <hi>Carrickfergus,</hi> and hath raiſed 500 horſes, and done much good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and now 'tis ſaid he muſt looſe all his men and the charge he hath been at in raiſing them.</p>
            <p>The Lady <hi>Hoy,</hi> the Lady <hi>Davis,</hi> the Lady <hi>Loftus,</hi> their Children and many more are newly landed from <hi>Cheſter:</hi> We cannot yet learne what is become of Colonel <hi>Plunket.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> cannot doe any thing, for he hath not 40. men that will ſtick to him, The Towneſmen of <hi>Galway</hi> did offer to ſeaze upon the Fort, but when they did ſee 3. or 4. of their men fall, they all ranne away, So fare you well.</p>
